### A lightweight clock that displays over your screen with much thought put into it.

## What is this?
AGOC is an <ins>extremely customizable</ins> desktop clock that displays over your other windows

Useful for people who have auto-hiding taskbars (Very common on laptops) but you still want to see the time!

Includes smart handling of the mouse so you can still interact with elements under the clock, so you never give up valuable screen real estate!

### Customization
The customization file is accessible though the tray menu.

You can customize its appearance down to the shadows and corner radius, change the layout of the text, and even change its behaviour, letting it also hide when your mouse is at the bottom of your screen. (Useful for auto-hiding taskbars, as the taskbar doesnt always stay on top of the clock.)

**Visual Studio Code is highly recommended for modifying the config file as it increases visibility, but it is not required.**

### Why did I make this?
I decided to create this application to fill a void in the available apps today: A well thought out overlay clock that doesn't hog your screen space, your CPU, or your sanity.
Previous apps I've used were all either not adaptable enough, too buggy, or just kinda ugly.
This aims to fill that void, with fully configurable appearances and running on under 300\* lines of code.
I've worked on this for **2 entire days**\*\*, and I had just begun to lose my sanity after I finished it.
###### \*The main Python file (pre-compiled) has just under 300 lines of code, as of v1.0.
###### \*\*Work time for v1.0 was about 2 days, including nighttime. (About 24h or so)

## How to install (or more accurately, not install.)
###### It's a portable. Please get the joke.

- Go to the [latest releases](https://github.com/FractalScripts/actually-good-overlay-clock/releases)
- Download `AGOC.zip`
- Extract the zip to wherever you want
- Run `AGOC.exe`
  - Windows SmartScreen might pop up warning you of the program. This is because AGOC is <ins>unsigned software</ins>. This is completely normal and as long as you are downloading the app from the [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/FractalScripts/actually-good-overlay-clock), it is completely safe.
  - To bypass Windows SmartScreen, click <ins>More info</ins> and <ins>Run anyway</ins>.
- There will be a tray icon that could be hidden. You can exit the app there.
- The configuration file (`config.py`) is located in the same folder as the executable.
- Refer to `timeFormat.txt` for the time syntax.
