### A lightweight clock that displays over your screen with much thought put into it.

## What is this?
This is a simple program made in pure python that displays the time (and other things) as a small window on top of your desktop screen.
This program is <ins>portable</ins>, meaning you can move the folder anywhere on your computer and it will still work.

## How it functions
A quick explanation:
  It essentially takes your configuration from the config.py file and applies it to a window that displays the time.
  This window is <ins>overlayed</ins> onto your screen, causing it to be above all other windows.
  It detects if your mouse is within the window/taskbar, and if so, it dims to the appropriate amount.
Now obviously its more complicated than that but thats the general idea behind it.
